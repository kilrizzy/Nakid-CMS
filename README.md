Thanks for checking out Nakid CMS.

Nakid CMS is built with CodeIgniter as a stand-alone content management system. You can drop in snippits of code onto your existing website that will pull in dynamic content.

Here's a cheesey commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63ngtGpabs

The first thing you want to do is setup the config.php file located in this folder with your current database settings.

Thanks!

###To Do
- Currently, a non-licensed application recieves an annoying advert in the administration panel. I will be removing this soon so there will be no more free / premium versions of nakid.
